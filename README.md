<h3> Introduction </h3>

My name is Haison Nguyen and I'm currently taking a class: CS410: Rust Programming. I'm currently working on a term project - Connect4Square - using Rust-wasm, which essentially is a web assembly pack that binds Rust and Javascript code together, resulting in a fully functional Rust web application. Connect 4 square is just like the well known version - Connect 4 - except that it's in a square matrix instead of circles.

<h3> How it works </h3>

The rules are simple:
1. Each player takes a turn choosing the position of their next move.
2. When a player accumulates 4 total squares of their color in a row  (horizontal, vertical or diagonal), they win!
3. If a game ends without a winner, both players lose. (Rule of thumb: If you're not first, you're last).
